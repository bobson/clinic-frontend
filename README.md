# Clinic Admin Frontend

This is the frontend application for the Clinic Admin Panel built with Next.js and TypeScript. It allows users to manage patients and appointments seamlessly.

## Note

When first open the app please wait 1 minute to activate the server host for the backend data to be fetch, because I am using free hosting provider.

- **Ant Design** — UI component library providing professional and responsive design.
- **React Hooks** — For managing state and lifecycle methods in functional components.
- **Responsive Design** — Mobile-friendly layout using Ant Design’s Grid and Drawer components.
